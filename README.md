# CogniRay

CogniRay is an experimental cognitive memory system built upon the principles of **Holographic Projection Memory (HPM)**.
It is designed as a structured, differentiable, and geometrically projective memory substrate that supports active inference,
directional recall, and adaptive semantic imprinting.

This repository contains:

* Theoretical foundations of Holographic Projection Memory (HPM) and CogniRay (see `docs/`)
* Minimal working implementation of HPM (read/write logic) (see `src/`)
* Examples and exploratory notebooks demonstrating usage (see `examples/`)
* *[Planned]* Core library for structured memory interfaces (see `cogniray/`)

---

## Key Concepts

* **Geometric Access to Memory** — Memory is accessed via projection rays, not keys or indices
* **Differentiable Projection** — Read and write are defined by kernel-weighted integration along rays
* **Topological Divergence** — Conflicting updates self-organize into distinct semantic clusters
* **Inference-Time Plasticity** — Memory can adapt in real time via projection-aligned delta updates
* **Multi-Scale Scanning** — Efficient attention to relevant memory regions through hierarchical projection

Roadmap:
1. Stable research release (v0.1)
2. Core CogniRay module for PyTorch
3. Adaptive projection routing and multi-view memory
4. Interactive visualization and ray tracing interface
