# Chapter A - Active Inference Memory (Theoretical Perspective)

> *A speculative extension of the Holographic Projection Memory mechanism within the DyNA framework.*

## A.1 Conceptual Overview

While the base formulation of Holographic Projection Memory (HPM) assumes passively sampled memory projections, the differentiable structure of the system allows - at least in theory - an **active memory model**, in which inference-time signals may directly modify or reinforce the memory field $W$ based on contextual outcomes.

This section explores the notion of **active inference memory** - a self-adjusting differentiable memory surface whose internal structure can be updated during inference in response to the observed error or reinforcement signal.

## A.2 Motivation

In many cognitive systems - biological or artificial - learning is not confined to distinct training epochs. Instead, memory representations adapt during interaction. The proposed HPM model, owing to its local and interpretable gradient flow, enables a form of runtime plasticity.

## A.3 Memory Update Principle

Let $T(u)$ denote the current projection (shadow) of the memory $W(x)$ along a specific projector configuration $\ell_u$, and let $\, \delta(u) = T^*(u) - T(u) \,$ be the observed projection-level error, where $T^*(u)$ is the desired/expected projection response.

Using the known form of the gradient:

$$
\frac{\partial T(u)}{\partial W(x)} = K(x, \ell_u)
$$

the following **local update** can be proposed:

$$
W(x) \leftarrow W(x) + \alpha \cdot \delta(u) \cdot K(x, \ell_u)
$$

Where:

* $\alpha$ is a step size (memory learning rate)
* $K$ is the same kernel used for projection

This equation implies that each projection error can **selectively adjust** the surrounding region of $W$, reinforcing or weakening specific configurations.

## A.4 Interpretation and Constraints

* This operation is **continuous and differentiable**, but unlike traditional gradient descent, it occurs **during inference**, without loss backpropagation.
* The system behaves analogously to **a content-addressable holographic surface**, where each projection acts both as a read and potential write mechanism.
* The update is **localized**, meaning it does not risk destabilizing the full structure unless induced errors are global or repeated.

However, it is important to note:

* No formal convergence guarantees exist.
* Without additional constraints, memory drift may occur over time.
* The approach assumes interpretability of the projection-target $T^*(u)$, which may not always be explicitly known.

> **Note on Convergence.**  
> The active memory update rule described above does **not guarantee convergence** in the classical optimization sense. The process is driven by local projection errors and applied without a global loss function or energy minimization.  
> While each update is bounded and spatially localized via the kernel $K(x, \ell_u)$, the aggregate effect of repeated, possibly conflicting updates may lead to stable adaptation, semantic drift, or divergence depending on system configuration.  
> A formal characterization of convergence behavior is **beyond the scope of this chapter** and is designated as a topic for future investigation.

## A.5 Use Case Scenarios (Hypothetical)

* **On-the-fly Adaptation**: Adjusting associations in memory after encountering novel examples
* **Feedback-based Refinement**: Using prediction error to reshape latent memory geometry
* **Runtime Memory Imprinting**: Encoding high-priority events directly into memory slices

## A.6 Summary

This theoretical extension introduces the notion of **active inference memory** within the HPM system. By leveraging the locality and transparency of gradient interactions, the memory field $W$ becomes potentially **updatable in real time**, enabling plastic and adaptive behavior.

> *Note: This remains a theoretical construction. Experimental validation is required to confirm feasibility, stability, and utility in practical learning systems.*
