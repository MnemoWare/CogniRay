# Chapter B - Associative Update Dynamics in Holographic Memory

> *A mathematical and conceptual clarification of nonlocal updates in holographically structured memory.*

---

## B.1 Background

In classical neural networks, memory or weight updates are usually localized via gradients and confined by backpropagation structures. However, the Holographic Projection Memory (HPM) mechanism allows for **direct, inference-time updates** of memory $W(x)$ via projection-domain errors $\delta(u)$.

The update rule:

$$
\Delta W(x) = \alpha \cdot \delta(u) \cdot K(x, \ell_u)
$$

is well-defined due to the explicit differentiability of the projection kernel $K(x, \ell_u)$. However, the kernel introduces **nonlocal effects**: the update is not applied at a single point but across a region defined by $K$. This chapter explains why such behavior is not an artifact or instability, but rather a **feature of associative memory dynamics**.

---

## B.2 Associative Kernel Interpretation

The kernel $K(x, \ell_u)$ is typically Gaussian:

$$
K(x, \ell_u) = \exp\left( -\frac{d(x, \ell_u)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
$$

which creates a spatial neighborhood of influence for each projection ray $\ell_u$.

If $x$ is close to $\ell_u$, it is considered **semantically aligned** with the projection $T(u)$. Thus, any update to $T(u)$ represents an **adjustment not just to a specific state, but to an entire class of correlated latent patterns**.

---

## B.3 Distributed Update Operator

Consider the aggregate update over a range of projection points:

$$
\Delta W(x) = \int_{\mathcal{U}} \delta(u) \cdot K(x, \ell_u) \, du
$$

This defines a new operator:

$$
\mathcal{T}^*{[\delta]}(x) := \int \delta(u) K(x, \ell_u) \, du
$$

which is the **adjoint** (transpose) of the forward projection operator $\mathcal{T}$. This operator effectively **back-projects** the projection-level error into the memory field - but does so in a **smooth, spatially correlated way**.

---

## B.4 Not Noise - But Generalization

This nonlocal behavior is **not a source of contamination or noise**, because:

1. The projection kernel $K$ defines a **semantic locality** - regions in $W$ that contribute similarly to a given projected shadow.
2. The update is weighted: distant or irrelevant components in $W$ are naturally suppressed.
3. It functions analogously to **Hopfield-style associative memory**, where stored states are not fixed points but **distributed attractors**.

### Key Interpretation:

The update $\Delta W(x)$ does not overwrite memory. It **gently shifts the geometry of latent associations**, reinforcing or weakening a class of similar internal responses.

---

## B.5 Behavioral Implication

Let $T(u)$ be a projection encoding the system's behavior or expectation in a context $u$.

Then an update:

$$
\delta(u) = T^*(u) - T(u)
$$

induces a deformation in $W$, such that the next projection in a **similar** context $u' \approx u$ results in a **modified behavior**:

$$
T_{\text{new}}(u') = \int W_{\text{new}}(x) K(x, \ell_{u'}) dx
$$

Thus, the system exhibits:

* **Behavioral generalization**: updates affect similar contexts
* **Associative correction**: the memory field adjusts latent modes of behavior
* **Plasticity without instability**: no need for global weight resynchronization

---

## B.6 Summary

The distributed nature of updates in HPM is not a flaw but an intentional mechanism of **semantic generalization** and **associative adaptation**.

By encoding similarity through the geometry of projection kernels, memory corrections propagate to semantically relevant regions.  

> **Caveat:** While projection kernels focus updates toward semantically aligned regions, this mechanism does *not inherently prevent interference* when projections overlap. In high-density or misaligned cases, preserving older memories may require explicit divergence, scheduling, or suppressive update modes.  

This results in behavior that is:  

* Consistently modifiable
* Contextually aware
* Aligned with human-like generalization

> *In this architecture, generalization is not learned - it is built into the memoryâ€™s very geometry.*
