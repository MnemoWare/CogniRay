# Chapter H - Delta-Learning

> *A projection-aligned protocol for memory adaptation through perceptual error correction in Holographic Projection Memory (HPM).*

---

Delta-Learning is the mechanism by which Holographic Projection Memory (HPM) performs local memory updates driven by discrepancies between desired and actual perceptual responses. Unlike conventional gradient descent, which relies on global backpropagation through a parameterized network, Delta-Learning operates entirely within the geometric framework of HPM. It enables inference-time plasticity, localized semantic refinement, and structured imprinting along differentiable projection paths.

At its core, Delta-Learning treats each directional projection as a reversible sensing-and-writing interface. If a projection $T(u)$ emitted from a surface point $u$ fails to match a target value $T^*(u)$, the resulting error signal $\delta(u) = T^*(u) - T(u)$ is routed back into the memory field $W(x)$ along the same geometric ray $\ell_u(t) = \Phi(u) + t \cdot \mathbf{v}_u$ that was originally used for reading. This produces a correction that is spatially aligned, semantically coherent, and smoothly integrated into the memory structure.

Delta-Learning preserves the topological and differentiable structure of HPM. It respects the locality induced by the projection kernel $K(x, \ell_u)$, supports frequency-selective updates in spectral memory representations, and integrates naturally with the multiscale memory scanning procedure outlined in Chapter G. The resulting process is fully compatible with rasterized implementations and gradient-survivable engineering pathways, as developed in Chapters E and F.

In what follows, we formalize Delta-Learning as a field-theoretic mechanism. We begin by defining error fields on projection surfaces, derive the associated memory update rules via kernel-weighted backprojection, and extend the formulation to compositional and spectral cases. Throughout, we maintain strict alignment with the directional projection protocol and memory geometry defined in preceding chapters.

### H.1 Introduction and Motivation

In high-dimensional memory architectures, the ability to refine internal representations during inference without retraining is critical for continual adaptation, real-time correction, and context-sensitive behavior. Traditional learning paradigms, which rely on error signals propagated through deep computation graphs, are poorly suited for this purpose: they are global, indirect, and computationally intensive.

Holographic Projection Memory (HPM) introduces a geometrically structured alternative. Instead of modifying abstract weights through backpropagation, HPM allows semantic expectations to be directly embedded into the memory field $W(x)$ via projection-aligned updates. This mechanism - Delta-Learning - harnesses the locality, directionality, and differentiability of the projection operator:

$$
T(u) = \int W(x) \cdot K(x, \ell_u) \, dx,
$$

to compute targeted corrections along the same spatial paths through which information is perceived.

Motivated by analogies to biological plasticity and principles of optical feedback, Delta-Learning treats memory as a responsive semantic medium. It interprets every projection as both a perceptual query and a writable interface. When a mismatch between predicted and desired output occurs, it triggers a geometrically localized update, reinforcing or reshaping the memory structure along that specific line of access.

This process supports:

* **Inference-time plasticity**: updates occur without parameter backpropagation.
* **Geometric locality**: changes affect only the subregion of $W(x)$ aligned with the ray geometry.
* **Semantic generalization**: updates propagate to similar contexts via smooth kernels.
* **Modular integration**: multiple projections can update memory in parallel, as long as they target spatially distinct or semantically orthogonal regions.

Delta-Learning enables HPM to act as an adaptive, introspective system: it senses, compares, and reorganizes its internal representations using the same directional primitives that govern perception. The remainder of this chapter details the formal principles, practical implementation, and advanced generalizations of this mechanism.

### H.2 Fundamentals of Delta-Learning

Delta-Learning begins with the observation that memory access in HPM is mediated through projection operators of the form

$$
T(u) = \int W(x) \cdot K(x, \ell_u) \, dx,
$$

where $u$ is a coordinate on a projection surface $\Phi(u) \subset \mathbb{R}^N$, and $\ell_u(t) = \Phi(u) + t \cdot \mathbf{v}_u$ defines a directed ray through memory space. Given a perceptual target $T^*(u)$, the projection error is defined pointwise as

$$
\delta(u) = T^*(u) - T(u).
$$

This error field $\delta(u)$ represents a structured, viewpoint-aligned discrepancy signal defined across the projection domain. It is not a scalar loss but a field of semantic corrections projected into the memory manifold.

To leverage this structure for memory adaptation, HPM defines a **kernel-weighted backprojection** of the error field into the latent memory volume. For each coordinate $u$ on the projection surface, the corresponding directional contribution to the memory update is given by:

$$
\Delta W(x; u) = \alpha \cdot \delta(u) \cdot K(x, \ell_u),
$$

where:

* $\alpha$ is a learning rate or modulation factor,
* $K(x, \ell_u)$ is the same projection kernel used for forward projection,
* the support of $K$ defines the local region of influence in $x$-space.

The resulting $\Delta W(x; u)$ constitutes a localized update field aligned with the ray geometry $\ell_u$. This formulation ensures that updates are spatially bounded, directionally consistent, and semantically targeted. Unlike pointwise lookup updates or distributed gradient diffusion, Delta-Learning enforces topological coherence by adhering to the same geometric paths used in perception.

Crucially, this mechanism enables memory $W(x)$ to evolve not as a flat parameter grid but as a structured field shaped by the directional flow of perceptual error. Each projection ray thus becomes a channel of introspective modulation: sensing semantic discrepancy and routing its correction through the same spatial interface that perceived it.

### H.3 Surface-Aligned Field Updates

While individual projection rays provide a fine-grained conduit for memory updates, the full expressivity of Delta-Learning emerges when considering entire projection surfaces. Let $\Phi^{(0)} \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ be a differentiable $(N-1)$-dimensional surface embedded in memory space, and let $u \in \mathbb{R}^{N-1}$ parameterize points on this surface. Each point $u$ defines a directional ray $\ell_u(t) = \Phi(u) + t \cdot \mathbf{v}_u$, and the corresponding projection output is $T(u)$.

Given a target perceptual field $T^*(u)$ defined over $\Phi^{(0)}$, the associated error field is

$$
\delta(u) = T^*(u) - T(u), \quad u \in \Phi^{(0)}.
$$

We define the cumulative memory update induced by the entire surface as the integral of individual backprojected corrections:

$$
\Delta W(x) = \int_{\Phi^{(0)}} \alpha(u) \cdot \delta(u) \cdot K(x, \ell_u) \, du.
$$

This formulation enforces a structured semantic imprinting of perceptual expectations onto the memory field $W(x)$. Each point on the surface contributes a geometrically aligned update, and the superposition over $u$ yields a spatially coherent correction pattern.

Key properties of this update mechanism include:

* **Geometric consistency**: All updates align with the directional semantics defined by $\mathbf{v}_u$ and $\Phi(u)$.
* **Topological smoothness**: The integral over a continuous surface produces smooth deformation fields in $W(x)$.
* **Differentiability**: The entire operator $\Delta W(x)$ is differentiable with respect to $W$, $\Phi$, $\mathbf{v}_u$, and $\alpha$.
* **Locality**: For rapidly decaying kernels $K$, the effective support of the update is spatially confined.

This surface-aligned perspective transforms Delta-Learning from a set of isolated update steps into a unified field operation, consistent with the semantics of holographic projection. It allows perceptual discrepancies to be imprinted not as point corrections, but as coherent geometric adjustments distributed across a semantically defined region of the memory manifold.

### H.4 Regional Aggregation and Conflict Handling

In large-scale memory fields, perceptual input often spans multiple semantically distinct regions. Each region may be independently identified, scanned, and evaluated by HPMâ€™s adaptive projection protocol, yielding a corresponding target field $T_i^*(u)$ defined over a local projection surface $\Phi_i^{(0)}$ for region $\mathcal{R}_i^*$. The Delta-Learning procedure must therefore accommodate the aggregation of multiple structured updates into a coherent global memory modification.

Let ${(\Phi_i^{(0)}, T_i^*(u))}_{i=1}^k$ be a set of $k$ projection surfaces with associated targets. Each surface yields its own perceptual error field:

$$
\delta_i(u) = T_i^*(u) - T_i(u), \quad u \in \Phi_i^{(0)},
$$

and induces an update field via surface-aligned backprojection:

$$
\Delta W_i(x) = \int_{\Phi_i^{(0)}} \alpha_i(u) \cdot \delta_i(u) \cdot K(x, \ell_u) \, du.
$$

The global memory update is the additive superposition of these contributions:

$$
\Delta W(x) = \sum_{i=1}^k \Delta W_i(x).
$$

This additive structure is justified by the linearity of the projection operator and the separability of projection surfaces in the viewpoint domain. When the kernel supports of distinct $\Delta W_i(x)$ are disjoint or weakly overlapping, updates combine without interference. However, in scenarios where projection surfaces intersect or partially overlap in $x$-space, spatial conflict may arise.

To manage such conflicts, Delta-Learning exploits the inherent geometry of the projection kernel:

* In regions of **agreement**, where multiple projections induce similar updates, superposition leads to reinforcement.
* In regions of **conflict**, where updates are contradictory, interference can trigger topological divergence or semantic bifurcation, as described in Chapter C.

To ensure stable behavior in the presence of overlap, it is advisable to:

* Localize projection surfaces based on semantic or spatial clustering,
* Regularize learning rates $\alpha_i(u)$ to attenuate conflicting gradients,
* Exploit update compatibility metrics that encourage coherent aggregation.

The resulting aggregated update preserves the semantic individuality of each region while maintaining the global geometric integrity of the memory field.

### H.5 Spectral Delta-Learning (Optional Extension)

In memory systems where content is not only spatially distributed but also decomposed across frequency bases, Delta-Learning must account for the spectral structure of representation. Holographic Projection Memory allows such extension by incorporating a frequency-indexed field decomposition:

$$
W(x) = \sum_k \hat{w}_k(x) \cdot \phi_k(x),
$$

where $\phi_k(x)$ denotes a fixed or learnable spectral basis function (e.g., Fourier, wavelet, or localized harmonic modes), and $\hat{w}_k(x)$ is the corresponding spectral coefficient field. The projection operator then becomes frequency-resolved:

$$
T_k(u) = \int \hat{w}_k(x) \cdot \phi_k(x) \cdot K(x, \ell_u) \, dx.
$$

For each frequency $k$, the system defines a target response $T_k^*(u)$ and derives the error signal:

$$
\delta_k(u) = T_k^*(u) - T_k(u).
$$

The memory update in the spectral domain is performed by projecting this frequency-specific error field back into $\hat{w}_k(x)$ using the basis conjugate $\phi_k^*(x)$:

$$
\Delta \hat{w}_k(x) = \int_{u} \alpha_k(u) \cdot \delta_k(u) \cdot \phi_k^*(x) \cdot K(x, \ell_u) \, du.
$$

Finally, the update to the full memory field is reconstructed as:

$$
\Delta W(x) = \sum_k \Delta \hat{w}_k(x) \cdot \phi_k(x).
$$

This spectral variant preserves all core properties of Delta-Learning:

* **Directional alignment** via $K(x, \ell_u)$,
* **Frequency specificity** through selective modulation of $\hat{w}_k(x)$,
* **Structured backprojection** mediated by basis functions $\phi_k(x)$,
* **Compositionality** through the additive reconstruction over $k$.

Spectral Delta-Learning allows the memory system to adapt in a resolution- and content-aware manner, enabling localized updates in both spatial and frequency domains. It is particularly useful in scenarios involving hierarchical representations, periodic structures, or phase-sensitive content alignment. The combination of spatial ray geometry and spectral selectivity yields a powerful and expressive memory modulation protocol aligned with the full semantics of holographic projection.

### H.6 Practical and Theoretical Considerations

While Delta-Learning is conceptually defined as a continuous geometric mechanism, its implementation must account for the discrete, finite nature of digital computation and the operational constraints of runtime systems. This section addresses the primary concerns that arise when translating the theoretical formulation into practice.

#### H.6.1 Discrete Projection Grids

In most implementations, the projection surface $\Phi(u)$ is discretized into a finite set of viewpoints ${u_j}$, each associated with a ray $\ell_{u_j}$ and corresponding error $\delta(u_j)$. The surface integral in

$$
\Delta W(x) = \int_{\Phi} \alpha(u) \cdot \delta(u) \cdot K(x, \ell_u) \, du
$$

is then replaced by a summation:

$$
\Delta W(x) \approx \sum_j \alpha_j \cdot \delta_j \cdot K(x, \ell_{u_j}),
$$

where $\alpha_j = \alpha(u_j)$ and $\delta_j = \delta(u_j)$. This discrete form is compatible with batched computation and GPU-accelerated rasterization.

#### H.6.2 Gradient Survivability and Parameter Learning

Delta-Learning can propagate gradients not only into the memory field $W(x)$ but also into the parameters defining the projection geometry, such as $\Phi(u)$, $\mathbf{v}_u$, and the kernel hyperparameters (e.g., $\tau$, $\sigma$). Under stateless projection modes where these parameters are explicitly available, backpropagation remains exact. In stateful or rasterized settings, surrogate gradients (e.g., direction vectors from entry-exit geometry) may be employed.

#### H.6.3 Update Stability and Learning Rate Scheduling

Because Delta-Learning occurs during inference, repeated application may lead to unintended memory drift or saturation. To mitigate this, several strategies are recommended:

* **Learning rate decay**: Modulate $\alpha$ as a function of time, projection confidence, or local entropy.
* **Projection gating**: Apply updates only when $|\delta(u)|$ exceeds a meaningful threshold.
* **Normalization strategies**: Avoid direct normalization of $K$, but regulate the total magnitude of $\Delta W(x)$ via adaptive scaling.

#### H.6.4 Update Compatibility and Conflict Management

In densely scanned regions or during overlapping surface projections, multiple updates may converge on the same memory location. Ensuring that these updates do not interfere destructively requires evaluation of their compatibility:

* Compatible updates exhibit aligned semantic gradients and reinforce structure.
* Incompatible updates may require conflict-resolution mechanisms (e.g., vector field orthogonalization, clustering, or topological divergence protocols).

These considerations extend the utility of Delta-Learning to complex, dynamically evolving scenarios without sacrificing its geometric integrity. When implemented carefully, the mechanism remains lightweight, interpretable, and scalable - fully aligned with the operational principles of HPM.

### H.7 Cognitive and Symbolic Interpretation

Beyond its operational role in memory modulation, Delta-Learning offers a compelling framework for cognitive interpretation and symbolic integration. Its structure mirrors essential features of biological learning systems and provides a mathematically grounded model for introspective adaptation.

#### H.7.1 Perceptual Correction as Cognitive Alignment

In HPM, each projection $T(u)$ encodes a localized perceptual inference conditioned on direction and context. The Delta-Learning update

$$
\Delta W(x) = \alpha \cdot \delta(u) \cdot K(x, \ell_u)
$$

acts as a minimal perceptual adjustment mechanism - not to correct parameters in the abstract, but to align the memory substrate with experiential expectation. This is conceptually aligned with active inference models, where perception and memory co-evolve to minimize surprise.

#### H.7.2 Symbolic Generalization via Field-Based Updates

Unlike discrete rule-based systems, HPM encodes meaning through continuous geometric and semantic fields. Delta-Learning injects structured variation into these fields via local, direction-sensitive updates. This allows symbolic constructs - categories, roles, concepts - to emerge and differentiate as topological attractors within $W(x)$, governed by the cumulative effect of projection-induced corrections.

#### H.7.3 Interpretability through Directional Causality

Each instance of Delta-Learning is inherently traceable: for any change in $W(x)$, the originating projection $\ell_u$ and perceptual discrepancy $\delta(u)$ are explicitly known. This makes memory evolution both modular and interpretable. Causal chains can be constructed linking semantic content to specific perceptual mismatches, supporting symbolic reasoning over memory transformations.

#### H.7.4 Plasticity and Long-Term Stability

By distributing updates across projection-aligned paths, Delta-Learning ensures that memory changes remain localized, structured, and compatible with long-term semantic organization. Regions that undergo frequent correction evolve into stable attractor basins, while infrequent or contradictory updates remain transient. This dynamic underlies the balance between adaptive flexibility and representational persistence.

In this view, Delta-Learning is not merely a technical update rule but a principle of embodied cognition: memory is not statically encoded but continuously shaped by projection-based interaction with the environment, perception, and internal generative models.

### H.8 Summary and Use Cases

Delta-Learning provides a mathematically principled and operationally efficient mechanism for memory adaptation within Holographic Projection Memory. It enables inference-time modification of memory fields using structured perceptual error, ensuring that updates are geometrically aligned, spatially localized, and semantically coherent.

**Summary of Core Properties:**

* **Directional coupling:** Updates are guided by the same projection geometry that mediates perception.
* **Field alignment:** Corrections are distributed continuously over memory space via smooth projection kernels.
* **Compositionality:** Multiple projection surfaces may imprint overlapping yet distinct semantic regions.
* **Spectral generalization:** Frequency-aware updates enable phase- and scale-sensitive refinement.
* **Interpretability:** The causal link between projection, error, and memory change is explicit and inspectable.

By unifying perception and plasticity into a single, reversible operation, Delta-Learning transforms memory from a static repository into a dynamic, perception-coupled substrate for adaptive cognition.

**Illustrative Use Cases:**

* **Online concept refinement:** When an agent receives a corrected interpretation of an object or situation, it may backproject the perceptual error to realign the associated region in memory.
* **Rapid contextual imprinting:** During critical events, targeted projections can encode new semantic content in real time, shaping behavior without retraining.
* **Contrastive learning with minimal supervision:** By exposing the system to competing projection targets, Delta-Learning can spatially bifurcate conflicting hypotheses, enabling separation of concepts.
* **Viewpoint-dependent learning:** As agents navigate through continuous environments, projection surfaces adaptively imprint context-conditioned representations.
* **Semantic fusion in multimodal systems:** Multiple modalities (e.g., vision, language) may project distinct but correlated updates into shared memory coordinates, enabling cross-modal association.

Through its tight integration with projection geometry and its capacity for introspective modulation, Delta-Learning equips HPM with a form of plasticity that is both scalable and interpretable - a prerequisite for embodied intelligence, continual learning, and cognitively grounded inference.
