# Experiment 08: Topological Entanglement Under High-Density Projection Interference

## TODO — Draft Placeholder

Design and conduct a dedicated experiment to probe the emergence of persistent topological entanglement in HPM under conditions of high projection density and significant ray overlap.

### Objective (to be refined)

* Empirically verify whether nontrivial topological structures (e.g., cycles, persistent components) arise in the union of support regions $\Omega_\epsilon(u_i)$ when $M \gg 1$ and $\mu(\Omega_\epsilon(u_i)) \cdot M \gg \mu(V)$.
* Test whether such structures are robust to small perturbations of ray geometry.
* Determine whether these topological features correspond to interference effects, latent associations, or emergent compositionality in projection responses.

### Methodology (to be formulated)

* Generate dense projection sets with controlled overlap.
* Measure homology groups ($H_0$, $H_1$, potentially $H_2$) over the union of support masks.
* Analyze correlation between topological features and projection anomalies.
* Vary kernel shape, scale, and anchor sampling strategy to probe robustness.

### Justification

This experiment is required to validate the assumption that high overlap in projection supports can induce persistent topological features — and to empirically ground the use of Nerve-based reasoning as a model of geometric interference in memory saturation.
