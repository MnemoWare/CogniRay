# Experiment 09: Projection Degradation under Overlap Density Accumulation

## TODO — Draft Placeholder

Design and conduct an experiment to evaluate how projection fidelity degrades as a function of cumulative support overlap in HPM. This study aims to empirically validate whether a critical overlap density $\rho_{\mathrm{crit}}$ exists, beyond which projection error increases sharply or becomes unstable.

### Objective (to be refined)

* Determine whether the normalized overlap density $\rho = \frac{1}{\mu(V)} \sum_i \mu(\Omega_\epsilon(u_i))$ serves as a robust predictor of projection fidelity.
* Empirically assess whether there exists a phase transition in $|T(u) - T^*(u)|$ behavior around a critical threshold $\rho_{\mathrm{crit}}$.
* Investigate how this behavior depends on kernel parameters $\sigma$, $\tau$ and ray sampling strategy.

### Methodology (to be formulated)

* Initialize a clean memory field $W(x)$.
* Incrementally write increasing numbers of random projections (e.g., 64 → 4096) while tracking $\rho$.
* For each stage, evaluate $T(u)$ vs. $T^*(u)$ and record the $L^2$ error.
* Repeat for multiple kernel settings to analyze effect of support volume.

### Justification

This experiment is necessary to support or reject the implicit claim that HPM exhibits a capacity transition governed by geometric overlap, measurable via the scalar variable $\rho$. A confirmed threshold would provide a practical tool for memory budgeting and adaptive kernel scheduling.
